Game Entry for the Adventure Game Jam 2023 

"Scam I Am" is a 2d top down decision making game.

Navigate a morally ambiguous world where every successful scam inches you closer to dismantling the fraudulent empire. Uncover the dark secrets behind the operation, forge alliances with unlikely allies, and strategically choose between maintaining your cover and exposing the truth. Will you emerge as the unsung hero, bringing justice to the victims of these scams, or succumb to the seductive allure of the criminal underworld?
